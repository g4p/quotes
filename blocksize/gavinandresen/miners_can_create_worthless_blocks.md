# Gavin Andresen: Miners Can Abuse the Blockchain

> But be aware that any patch that is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks will be rejected, and I can't think of a way to automatically adjust the block size that wouldn't be vulnerable to some big, anti-social miner (think "jerk with a botnet") deciding it would be fun to artificially drive up transaction volume, drive up the block size, and create a few gigabytes of worthless blocks we all get to download forevermore.

> When we get close to bumping into the block size limitation it will be easy to convince a majority of the network to upgrade-- that's one problem that is obvious and easy to fix.
