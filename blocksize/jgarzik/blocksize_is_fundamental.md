# Jeff Garzik - Satoshi Intended Blocksize as a Fundamental Scarce Resource

*Satoshi* *fee-market* *unlimited*

Satoshi also intended the subsidy-free, fee-only future to support bitcoin. He did not describe fancy assurance contracts and infinite block sizes; he cleared indicated that fees would be driven in part by competition for space in the next block.

Unlimited block sizes are also a radical position quite outside whatever was envisioned by the system's creator -- who cleared did think that far ahead.
