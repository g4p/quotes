# Jeff Garzik - The Blocksize Limit Is Fundamental

*fee-market*

Actually it is more fundamental than that: block size is an economically limited resource, just like the famous 21,000,000 limit.

Increasing block size decreases scarcity, and thereby (a) decreases the incentive to conserve block space, and (b) decreases competitive bidding for the limited block space.

In other words, it is a bad idea to change willy-nilly, or even worse, remove the limit or vastly increase it.

The limit should only be increased due to absolute necessity.
