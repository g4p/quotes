# Jonathan Toomim: China Cannot Handle a Larger Blocksize

*scalability* *gfw* *china*

> Most of the rest of the world can handle 2 MB, 4 MB, 8 and 9 MB is starting to push it, but I think we can do it. China though cannot. And.. where did it go? ergh. We can do all sorts of stuff. We can start uploading in multiple directions once we get the first byte, we could make it like bittorrent and use DHTs. We need to get the Chinese pools to move their block creation out of the country. They can stick the coinbase transaction into the header in China, but everything else can be done outside of China. This would only require 1 kilobyte of traffic through the Great Firewall, without increasing or decreasing block size.
