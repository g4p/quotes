# Gavin Andresen: What if Coin Tracking is Good?

> I'll play devil's advocate a little bit: maybe the "slippery slope" argument is wrong-- maybe "dirty" coin tracking from competing non-governmental organizations would be a good thing for the world. Maybe supporting a free-market of organizations performing those services will make it less likely that governments decide they must step in and mandate a solution that they create.
