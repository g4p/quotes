# Gavin Andresen: Ordinary Bitcoin Users Should Not Run Nodes

> Most ordinary folks should NOT be running a full node. We need full nodes that are always on, have more than 8 connections (if you have only 8 then you are part of the problem, not part of the solution), and have a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet.
 So: if you've got an extra virtual machine with enough memory in a data center, then yes, please, run a full node.
