*mining* *PoW*

> There is no "force", there is choice.  Each user chooses the software they run to validate the chain.  If a majority of users choose to switch to SHA-512, that is what will happen, regardless of the number of miners who switch.

> 51% hashing power, or even 90%, means nothing if clients collectively refuse to accept and relay your blocks.
