# Jeff Garzik: The Blocksize Debate is Preventing Launches

> One group advocates doubling the size of the "blocks" in Bitcoin, something that could help, but may be short-term.

> Another group advocates rewriting its underlying protocols to have far more blocks - a solution that would make old Bitcoins incompatible with the new ones. For companies that are thinking of using blockchain tech or digital currency, this schism makes it hard to choose Bitcoin. 

> "This is sending signals that are making engineers worried," says Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's core developers. "People are waiting to see what happens before launching."
