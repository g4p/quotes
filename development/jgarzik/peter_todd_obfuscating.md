# Jeff Garzik - Peter Todd is Blatantly Obfuscating A Stealth Policy Change

> Blatant obfuscation.

> There is a new policy being put into place - "let a fee market develop" - which freezes out anything related to a size limit increase.

> This new policy has not been communicated to users, nor any transition to the new policy planned.

> You don't jerk around users this way. Any new policy should be announced in advance. Users should be given time to understand the new policy and transition to it.
