# Mike Hearn: Core is a Complete Writeoff as a Project

> The bigger issue, which the community only just now seems to be waking up to, is that Core is a complete writeoff as a project. Basing their fork on the latest Core may seem like an obvious move, but a lot of the stuff that's gone into Core during the 0.12 development cycle is garbage and needs to be removed. For example the RBF changes, the SegWit stuff that'll get dropped in there at some point, Strateman's connection DoS code (it's not properly thought through), all the complexity around soft forks and so on.
