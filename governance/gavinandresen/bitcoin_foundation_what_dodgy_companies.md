# Gavin Andresen: What Dodgy Companies Does The Bitcoin Foundation Have as Members?

> What scammers and dodgy companies are you talking about?

> A hard fact of life is 'most startups fail.' MANY Foundation member companies will fail-- if you have a way of telling in advance which are dodgy/scammy and which are just unlucky, a bad business idea, or poorly run I would love to hear it.

> (Besides obvious scams like the recent MMMglobal membership that was just revoked).
