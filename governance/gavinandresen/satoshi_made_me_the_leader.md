# Gavin Andresen: Satoshi Appointed Me The Leader of the Bitcoin Project

> I started to submit code to Satoshi [Nakamoto, bitcoin’s mysterious and anonymous creator] to improve the core system. Over time he trusted my judgment on the code I wrote. And eventually, he pulled a fast one on me because he asked me if it’d be OK if he put my email address on the bitcoin homepage, and I said yes, not realizing that when he put my email address there, he’d take his away. I was the person everyone would email when they wanted to know about bitcoin. Satoshi started stepping back as leader of project and pushing me forward as the leader of the project.
