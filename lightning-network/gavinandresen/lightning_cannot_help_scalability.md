# Gavin Andresen: The Lightning Network Not A Scaling Solution

> I think the Lightning Network is a fantastic idea and a great experiment and will likely be used for all sorts of great payment innovations (micropayments for bandwidth maybe, or maybe paying workers by the hour instead of at the end of the month). But I don't think it is a scaling solution for the types of payments the Bitcoin network is handling today.
