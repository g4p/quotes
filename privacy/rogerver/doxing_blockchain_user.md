# Roger Ver - Using Administrative Powers to Publicly Dox a Blockchain Wallet User

> Unfortunately an extra 4.5119 was also sent to him that he is refusing to return. (I understand that this is partially Bitcoinstore's fault)

> The Bitcoin address and payments in question are:  http://blockchain.info/address/1H4UR5M72Ybpo4zrqWe8JKKYSeN1gxqBcU

> He has refused to refund the money when asked via email,  and when I called on the telephone,  he hung up on me as soon as I told him my name.

> Other than the reputational enforcement from this posting,  I don't know what else can be done.  

## BlockChain.info Dev Responds

> I do not know the sepcifics but there was some disagreement between Roger and a customer of bitcoinstore.com. The customer claimed not to own a particular bitcoin address that a incorrect amount had been refunded to. Roger used his access to the blockchain.info admin panel to lookup the information on a wallet which held that bitcoin address. This email address associated with the wallet and the email address of the customer matched.
