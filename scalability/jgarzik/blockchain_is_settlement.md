# Jeff Garzik - 7 TPS Is No Limit

*tps* *settlement* *off-chain* *Satoshi*

Transaction rates can easily scale far beyond 7 tps, even with 1MB limit in place.

The current network is just the base settlement layer.

Many organizations will layer instant payment networks, settlement networks, credit layers and other things on top of the current layer.

Anybody who looks at the current technology and assumes "that's all there is" or "the whole world is limited to the current network" makes fatally flawed assumptions.

Satoshi openly acknowledged this by noting insuitability of microtransactions for the current network, and it is clear that digitally signed messages may be sent, exchanged, combined by a myriad different payment processors, aggregators etc.
