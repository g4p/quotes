# Jeff Garzik - Off-Chain Scaling is a "Very Good, Very Realistic Solution"

*scalability* *microtransactions* *offchain*

However, standard disclaimer: bitcoin is not, and never will be, a micro-payment or micro-transaction network.

> Perhaps the solution can also be a de-centralized sub-network that works similarly as BTC that deal with smaller transactions and only charge the standard fee when pulling out?

Yes, this is called "off-chain transactions" and it is a very good, very realistic solution. No matter how much bitcoins scale up, there will always a market for micro-payments and micro-transactions. It is predicted that micro-payment services, bots and networks will appear to handle this use case.
