# Jeff Garzik: Smart Contracts Shoudl Be Removed From Bitcoin

> My strong preference is to move in the opposite direction:  drop scripts completely.  Admit that scripts are a mistake.  Sign simple transactions of in's and out's.  Rigorously standardize on a greatly simplified, basic functionality -- which is what we are doing, de facto, with changes like IsStandard.

> Oh I agree that removing scripting is both a radical proposal, and probably not realistic due to backward compatibility.

> Although I would support such a change, it was mainly to illustrate how little we use the script engine.  There have been so many limitations placed upon it for security / anti-spam / anti-bloat reasons in recent months that, IMO, if bitcoin were redesigned from scratch today, it might not have a script engine.
