# Gavin Andresen: I Don't Plan on Saving Bitcoins

> I don't plan on saving a significant number of Bitcoins as a store of value.  I like to invest in people who are doing productive things that grow our economy and make the world a better place, so when Bitcoins replace dollars  Wink  I'll lend them to people by buying bonds or stocks.
